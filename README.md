## About

I stepped away from doing websites at all for about 15 years or so, and certainly a lot has changed since I was hacking at HTML in the mid-90's. I took this up both to build a site as a future showcase of what I'm about and to have the opportunity to get familiar with what modern frameworks have to offer. Some two weeks later and the initial version of this page was born along with many more ideas of what to do with it.

### Technical Details

I built this to run as a static site to then be containerized with Nginx, hence the Dockerfile.

## Contributing

I tried to do my homework on this, as it were, but I also know that the field is wide and constantly changing its best practices. If you feel like sharing, I would absolutely love to learn!
